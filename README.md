# Appointment Automation

This is a simple program that is created using Java. The
purpose of program is to provide a platform which people can
reach and display their appointment.

Depends on this situation, the program user can delete
appointment which user has, create a new appointment, update a
certain appointment, display a certain appointment information
which include appointment time, appointment day, patient name,
surname, identification number, doctor name, surname,
department, the patient complaint for appointment and extended
patient, doctor information. In fact, the program user has a
chance to search a specific appointment from their complex
appointment table. Additionally, the program user can extract
all of their appointment or specific appointment information
to .pdf format and the program user can display statistical
data.

If I put in order basically,according to the user type, users can do:

-Select their appointment.

-Delete their appointment.

-Create new appointment.

-Edit an appointment.

-Display their appointment in a more complex way.

-Extract their appointment information to .pdf format.
